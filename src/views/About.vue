      <v-divider></v-divider>
      <p class="text-left pt-2">
        Imgbb.com does not require registration in order to upload images, so it
        doesn't record any email addresses. We do not collect any personally
        identifiable data on people who view images. Hovewer, when visitor
        uploads image to imgbb.com server information about visitor is recorded
        so in case of abuse of terms of service our staff can easily identify
        and block offending user. Information about uploader is available only
        to staff members that do moderation f images, that information will not
        be displayed anywhere in public or given to anyone.
